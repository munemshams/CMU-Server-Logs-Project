# CMU Server Logs Project
This project analyzes the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) machine usage logs of 3000+ users at Central Michigan University using R Studio, uncovering academic usage trends, seasonal fluctuations and identifying data issues. It also conducts data wrangling and filtering on the dataset, which is a huge one with 3.1 million initial observations before analyzing the data to support infrastructure improvements as well as provide recommendations. 

The entire project was performed in **R Studio**, including:
- Data import and cleaning
- Transformation and reshaping
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization
- A presentation video for a non-technical audience
